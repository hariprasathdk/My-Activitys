Method of Procedure (MOP): NTP Server Configuration using Chrony

Objective:
To configure a Linux system to use internal/external time sources for Network Time Protocol (NTP) synchronization using chronyd.

Step 1: Edit Chrony Configuration File

Open the chrony configuration file:
# vi /etc/chrony.conf

In the file, scroll to the section where NTP pools are defined. Add the following lines (or update them if already present):

pool timeserver1.india.com iburst
pool timeserver2.india.com iburst
pool timeserver3.india.com iburst
pool timeserver4.india.com iburst

Leave other configurations commented unless changes are specifically required. These lines allow the chrony service to sync time with the defined time servers.

Step 2: Restart the Chrony Service

# service chronyd restart
